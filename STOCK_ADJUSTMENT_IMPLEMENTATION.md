### Success Criteria
- [x] All inventory detail pages show transaction history
- [x] History component loads and displays data correctly
- [x] Filtering and sorting work in history views

  - Search across all transaction fields
  - Sortable columns (date, quantity, reason)
  - Reason-based filtering
  - CSV export functionality
  - Before/after stock level display
  - User accountability tracking
  - Transaction summary statistics
  - Seamless access - history visible immediately on detail pages
